# Shalom AI: The Chosen Language Model Testing Platform

## Overview

Welcome to Shalom AI, where we're on a mission from G-d to evaluate language models using the wisdom of our ancestors. Think of it as a digital Beit Midrash for AI, where we separate the kosher models from the traif!

## Features

- Create tests faster than you can say "Baruch Hashem"
- Integrate more language models than there are plagues in Egypt
- Run tests with the efficiency of a well-oiled dreidel
- Evaluate model performance like a discerning Bubbie at a blind date
- Track costs tighter than a Shabbat budget

## Why Torah Sources?

Because if AI can handle the complexities of Torah, it can handle anything! We're talking texts that have stumped scholars for millennia. If an AI can explain why you can't mix milk and meat, but fish is pareve, it's truly a marvel of modern technology.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (no circumcision required):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shalom-ai.git
   cd shalom-ai
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (think of it as a digital sukkah):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages (like preparing for Passover, but less cleaning):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the database (smoother than parting the Red Sea):
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create a superuser (like appointing a new rabbi, but with less fanfare):
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server (let there be light!):
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Access the admin interface at `http://localhost:8000/admin/`. It's like the Holy of Holies, but everyone's allowed in.

3. Use the API endpoints to run tests and retrieve results. It's like consulting the Urim and Thummim, but with more JSON.

## API Endpoints

- `/api/sources/`: Manage test sources (Torah, Talmud, your Bubbie's secret kugel recipe)
- `/api/tests/`: Create tests (harder than the 10 Commandments, easier than 613 mitzvot)
- `/api/language-models/`: Manage language models (from "Oy vey" to "Mazel tov")
- `/api/test-runs/`: Run tests (faster than a Hanukkah dreidel)
- `/api/evaluations/`: Evaluate results (more precise than a mohel)
- `/api/budgets/`: Manage budgets (tighter than Shabbat candle lighting times)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Just remember, every pull request is an opportunity for a mitzvah. May your code be as bug-free as matzah is of chametz!

Remember, in the world of AI, we're all wandering in the desert. But with Shalom AI, we're one step closer to the Promised Land of perfect language models. L'chaim to better AI!
